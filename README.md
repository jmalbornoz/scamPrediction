# Scam Prediction
Building a simple classification model for scam prediction

#### Problem: Retail bank identifying scam transactions

A large retail bank is aiming to better identify scam transactions. The dataset they provide contains a sample of information about historical transactions, the customers making the transactions and whether the transaction was fraudulent. They currently use a simple rules-based approach using a subset of the features in the dataset to flag transactions, but they are open to more complex solutions that can give better predictive power while remaining explainable.

The primary stakeholder on the client side is the Head of Fraud Operations, who has a strong commercial background but little understanding of data science or machine learning. With them in the meeting will be a Senior Data Analyst who will be evaluating the proposal from a technical perspective. Your presentation should be pitched to be relevant for both parties.

The clientâ€™s goal is to understand the following:  
- How can we more effectively identify scam transactions?
- What information is most relevant in identifying whether a transaction is a scam?
- Can we use any other data (internal or external) to help us identify whether the likelihood of scam transactions will increase? 
- Are there actions that can be taken to mitigate scam transactions?
